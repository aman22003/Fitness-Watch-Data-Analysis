Fitness Watch Data Analysis: Process We Can Follow
Fitness Watch Data Analysis is a crucial tool for businesses in the health and wellness domain. By analyzing user data from fitness wearables, companies can understand user behaviour, offer personalized solutions, and contribute to improving users’ overall health and well-being.

Below is the process we can follow while working on the problem of Fitness Watch Data Analysis:

Collect data from fitness watches, ensuring it’s accurate and reliable.
Perform EDA to gain initial insights into the data.
Create new features from the raw data that might provide more meaningful insights.
Create visual representations of the data to communicate insights effectively.
Segment user’s activity based on time intervals or the level of fitness metrics and analyze their performance.
So, the process starts with collecting data from a fitness watch. Every fitness watch works with an app on your smartphone. You can collect data from that app on your smartphone. For example, in my case, I collected my fitness watch’s data from Apple’s Health app. If you will also collect fitness data from any app, it will not be in a format to be used for analysis.  

Fitness Watch Data Analysis using Python
Now let’s get started with the task of Fitness Watch Data Analysis by importing the necessary Python libraries and the dataset:

import pandas as pd
import plotly.io as pio
import plotly.graph_objects as go
pio.templates.default = "plotly_white"
import plotly.express as px

data = pd.read_csv("Apple-fitness-Data.CSV")
Print(data.head())

Let’s have a look if this data contains any null values or not:

1. print(data.isnull().sum())print(data.isnull().sum())
Date                                 0
Time                                 0
